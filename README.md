##TorDDoS-Guard

Overview

TorDDoS-Guard is a tool designed to utilize the power of Tor to anonymously rotate IP addresses while conducting stress tests on your own services or infrastructure. IMPORTANT: This is for educational purposes only. Misuse can lead to legal consequences. Use it at your own risk and only on services you own or have explicit permission to test.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

> Hold up! Before you even think about running this script, let me drop some serious truth bombs. This is my first major project, and while Iâ€™m all about learning, Iâ€™m also NOT responsible for anything that goes wrong. Seriously, donâ€™t come crying to me if your account gets banned, your computer explodes, or if your internet provider suddenly sends you a bill for â€˜overuseâ€™.



> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK â€“ This tool is meant for educational purposes only. I donâ€™t endorse or encourage any illegal or malicious activity. But hey, if you decide to stress-test a random website and end up getting sued by the owners, Iâ€™ll be rolling on the floor laughing at your expense ðŸ˜‚. Youâ€™ve been warned!



> Wanna get your IP banned? Go ahead, run this tool on a random server. Wanna avoid getting banned? Maybe don't use this tool to mess with anyone who isn't begging for it. In case you do get banned? It's on YOU. Iâ€™m just here to provide some good techy fun â€“ NOT your scapegoat. ðŸ™„

Legal Disclaimer (Because Apparently, We Have To Say It):

By using this tool, you agree that you are solely responsible for all consequences. This includes any legal trouble, damage to your online reputation, or if you accidentally blow up your Wi-Fi router.

I am not responsible for anything that happens after you hit the run button. Seriously, anything.

How to Use TorDDoS-Guard (Responsible Usage)

1. Test on Your Own Infrastructure: Never use this tool to attack random services or websites without permission. It is illegal and unethical.


2. Use for Educational Purposes: This tool is designed to show how Tor can be used for stress testing, security research, and penetration testing in controlled environments.


3. Avoid Legal Trouble: If you use this tool improperly and face consequences (such as IP bans or legal action), it is on YOU, not me.
